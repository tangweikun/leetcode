# 104.Self Dividing Numbers

## Description

A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, `128` is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

## Example

```
Input: 1, 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
```
