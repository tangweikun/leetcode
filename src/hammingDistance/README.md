# 50.Hamming Distance

## Description

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

## Note

0 ≤ x, y < 231

## Example

```javascript
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
