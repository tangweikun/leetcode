# 130.Jewels and Stones

## Description

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

## Example1

```javascript
Input: (J = 'aA'), (S = 'aAAbbbb')
Output: 3
```

## Example2

```javascript
Input: (J = 'z'), (S = 'ZZ')
Output: 0
```

## Note

* S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in J are distinct.
