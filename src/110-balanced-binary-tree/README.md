# 194.Balanced Binary Tree

## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

> a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

## Example1

```js
Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Return true.
```

## Example2

```js
Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:

       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4

Return false.
```
